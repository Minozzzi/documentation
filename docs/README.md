OpenHaus consists of diffrent parts, where each has a special purpose:
- [backend](https://github.com/OpenHausIO/backend) (Provides a API, handle commands & states and store items in the database)
- [frontend](https://github.com/OpenHausIO/frontend) (User interface for interaction with the backend)
- [connector](https://github.com/OpenHausIO/connector) (Connection between your local network (LAN) and the backend)
